        "description": "The concept for this mural is based on the idea of wellness and well-being in an urban environment. The composition is rich with symbolic imagery, from the lotus as the achievement of health in an urban context, to the butterflies as a representation of change, to the images of the buildings and Mt. Hood as a sign of strength and a hopeful future. The mural integrates these different elements with the architecture of the building and creates a landscape that flows and connects to the next building featuring a second mural by Hector Hernandez, Butterfly horizon. The subject matter of this neighboring mural is that of hope, and the Urban Wellness mural the blooming of wellness from that hope.",

        "description": "Three geometric abstract steel sculptures are placed in a raised landscaped area in and located directly south of the Thurman Street Bridge.  In siting the work, the artist wanted the sculptures to respond both to the surrounding greenspace (thus, the bright red color) and to the broad horizontal expanse of the Thurman Street bridge (thus, the vertical nature of the sculptures).  At the time the pieces were installed, Vern Luce lived near Lower MacLeay Park and selected the site both for its visual beauty and its proximity to his home.\n\nProject History\nThe Comprehensive Education Training Act of the early 70's provided grants to a number of Portland artists that enabled them to create artwork.  As a result, over 500 works by 52 artists became part of the City of Portland's collection, providing a rich and diverse history of art in Portland.  Aside from Lower MacLeay Park, two other Portland parks feature permanent sculptures acquired through this program: a sculpture by Bruce West in Lair Hill Park and a piece by Jerry Allen in Peninsula Park.",

        "description": "Many critics consider the painter Carl Morris to be one of Oregon's most historically important abstract expressionists. With a background in figurative painting, he pursued the exploration of mood, thought, and feeling through abstract works. His abstract paintings were generally based on nature, poetry, scenery, and his never ending curiosity.  Among his many accomplishments, he and his wife, Hilda Morris, received the prestigious Governor's Art Award in Oregon in 1985.\n\nAbstract Expressionism often describes a general attitude rather than a set of concrete facts and artists working in this style generally place great value on spontaneous improvisation and individuality.  Their work may appear to have been created by accident or chance, but it is always thoughtful and can even be highly planned.",

        "description": "Gregory Grenon is widely recognized for his expressionist paintings of women.  His emotionally charged paintings command attention with their bold gestures and vivid colors.  About Young Girl he writes: \"I wanted to do a full-face figure, one that came right out of the picture. I first got the idea to paint that way when I was living in Chicago, and would go to see old Bette Davis movies.  Her whole face would take up the screen.  I was especially happy when this painting was placed in the Civic Auditorium, where a younger audience could be exposed to my work.  I'm always excited when young people see my work.\"\n\nGrenon, who moved to Portland in the 1970's, considers his most valuable artistic learning experience to be his time spent as a printmaking apprentice at Landfall Press in Chicago.  He also studied at Wayne State University and the Society of Arts and Crafts, both in Detroit, Michigan.",

When the inner painting is opened up it reveals a blooming garden representing man's future.  McClarty says: \"It's a kind of space garden, a garden of the future. I was playing with the themes of dark and light, good and bad, past and future.\"\n\nThis was McClarty's first work in acrylic, a change from the oil paint which he had used up to that point.",

        "description": "The theme of this painting relates to theater and landscape in an allegorical sense.  The screen-like structure refers to the stage and the curtain which rises to reveal the drama.\n\nThough all of the figures in the painting relate to the theater, they have other references as well.  The large head at the left is the \"director-observer\".  In the next panel a figure appears to be leaping in front of a form which is both spotlight and moon.  In the center panel a series of profiles represents the audience, but can also be seen as a single head in movement.\n\nThe next panel reveals forms symbolizing clouds which drift from the painting's interior out toward the spectator.  And the last panel shows a group of figures representing acrobats or tumblers, who also stand to represent the inter-relatedness of people.",

Folk art is the product of a specific cultural group, where form, design and materials are passed down from one generation to another.  This piece, made by a Hmong master stitcher, uses traditional Hmong colors and patterns.  \n\nThe Hmong are an ethnic group from the Lao mountains of Southeast Asia.  Many of the Hmong have been displaced from their homelands, and have found refuge in communities within the United States. Portland is pleased to be one on those communities.\n\nThe process of settling into a new culture has influenced Hmong textiles. Consumer demand has altered some of the designs and color patterns of their work, although records suggest that this piece holds to a more historical tradition.",

Canoe Paddle is a functional instrument; Ken calls it \"a hybrid instrument.\"\n\nThe artist used an archer's bow for the strumming bow, which doubles as a stand.  Base guitar strings were then attached to the paddle, and electronic pick-ups installed to allow the piece to be plugged into an amplifier and played as an electronic instrument.\n\nKen says he chose a canoe paddle for the body of the guitar because: \"It is relationally, in size and shape, an almost perfect match to the guitar.  A tuning fork even fits perfectly in the hand grip.\"",

Folk art is the product of a specific cultural group, where form, design and materials are passed down from one generation to another.  This piece, made by a Hmong master stitcher, uses traditional Hmong colors and patterns.  \n\nThe Hmong are an ethnic group from the Lao mountains of Southeast Asia.  Many of the Hmong have been displaced from their homelands, and have found refuge in communities within the United States, Portland is pleased to be one on those communities.\n\nThe process of settling into a new culture has influenced Hmong textiles. Consumer demand has altered some of the designs and color patterns of their work, although records suggest that this piece holds to a more historical tradition.",

        "description": "In 1958 the owners of the Fleet Donut Shop commissioned the prominent Northwest artist Louis Bunce to paint a mural about Portland for their shop. Subsequently purchased by John T. Booth, a retired economist and art collector, the mural was located in various sites throughout the city before being permanently installed at the Oregon Convention Center.\n\nThe painting features familiar locations from Portland's late 1950's urban landscape ?\" a cluster of figures gathered at the Yamhill Street Farmers' Market, prominent architectural landmarks, and newly constructed freeway ramps to the bridges. The Skidmore Fountain and the Elk ?\" popular historic sculptures and notable pieces in the public art collection ?\" are prominently placed in the mural, as is a Benson Bubbler.",

It was created as a contribution from elders from the Northeast Multicultural Senior Center who helped paint the frame to the youth to give them a sense of ancestral pride in knowing who we are, and acknowledging our historical greatness. The painting is about the human race and is a visual journey in education and awareness. Figures of children are depicted playing everyday games and are interwoven with African symbols from Adinkra and ancient Egyptian traditions.",

        "description": "I investigate the small stuff: the twirling samara, the leaf skeleton, the emerging fiddlehead.  In my studio, there are all sorts of seeds, leaves and plant stems floating around.\n\nIn creating pieces for the Midland Library, I designed cast stone medallions for the north and south walls of the buildings exterior.   I wished to link the library to the small park next to it.  I wanted the work to be bold shapes that could be viewed as one walked by, but also could be understood from a distance.\n\nI began thinking of different shapes; an x, a spiral, a diagonal ellipse.  At the same time, I was gathering leaves.  I started making many small models in clay.  Eventually I chose to sculpt native northwest leaves: rhododendron, fern, dogwood, maple and alder.  After I selected these five forms I created more specific models.  At the time, I was learning to paint egg tempera, so I made studies using this technique.\n\nA wooden box \"frame\" was constructed; this would be the size and shape of the final piece and would house the modeled clay leaf.  As a piece was shaped, I would periodically move it outdoors and orient it toward the South, so I could get a sense of shadow at different times of the day. \n\nFrom the wood and clay model, a rubber mold was mad.  These were then transported out to the casting company, where they were filled with a cast stone mix which had been specified by the architect.  The pieces were bundled and trucked to this site.  The medallions were paired in different combinations and installed by some very strong brick masons.",

A dedication was held on May 30,1925, with a reading of remarks from President Calvin Coolidge and French President Gaston Doumergue.  \n\nThe sculpture was rededicated in May 2002 following a major restoration project and after nearly three years of grassroots planning and fundraising.  Generous support came from a Save Outdoor Sculpture! grant with generous support from Target Stores, the National Endowment for the Arts, and matching funds from Providence Health Systems and citizens from the community.",

The painting looks down the length of the building to the open glass wall where you can see real trees catching sunlight, rain, and wind in real space.\n\nThe artist's intention for this piece was to invent a metaphysical reflection of nature that wants to be gazed at for itself, and to serve as a reminder to study the real thing through reading. The painting also strives to be worthy of its center stage position in the elegant grid that characterizes the library, giving a soft illusion of space at the end of the dynamic perspective of the rows of black columns which frame it.",

The basalt is surrounded by a wildflower-seeded lawn and linden trees.\n\nSix aluminum wall plaques offer clues to what the plaza site was like at various stages of its history from 1851 (starting at the west end of the plaza) to the present (the plaque closest to 106th St.).",

        "description": "The paintings' overlapping and superimposed images represent the way diverse parts of Southeast Portland fit together in harmonious, beautiful, and unique ways.\n\nFresco Process\nFresco painting is one of the most ancient and durable of all painting mediums.  The process begins with a rather elaborate preparation of the materials.  The fresco plaster is of critical importance in the process and is made by burning limestone, pulverizing the results of the burning and then mixing water into the powder.  The longer the plaster is aged the more plastic, whiter and less caustic it becomes.  The plaster used in the mural is about a year and a half old.  The surface is prepared with a mixture of the plaster and sand.  Only one day's worth of painting is plastered each day.  The images are painted on top of this finish coat with pigments grounded in distilled water.  If the painter is dissatisfied with any part of the painting, that part must be chipped off, replastered, and painted.  After one year, the pigment and the plaster sand mixture fuse into a permanent and water resistant surface.",

Garth Edwards was selected by the architects from the Regional Arts & Culture Council's Design Team Roster, a collection of artists who are experienced in working closely with architects throughout the development of a project. Thompson Vaivoda collaborated with Edwards from the design through the completion of the East Portland Community Center. RACC's Public Art Advisory Committee, made up of artists, designers and community members oversaw the artistic portion of the project.",

        "description": "Jack McLarty, a lifelong Portlander, grew up within three blocks of Portland's City Hall and attended the Museum Art School (now the Pacific Northwest College of Art), where he later taught.  Since early in his career, when he decided to do what he knew best, his paintings have included Portland imagery.\n\nA large mural of colored woodcut panels entitled A Portland Story was installed on the third floor of City Hall as part of the City's Percent for Art program.  McLarty sees the Willamette River as the heart of the City and made it the central focus of the piece.  The side panels (from which the cover detail is taken) represent incidents, people, and buildings important throughout Portland's history.  (Refer to the key on the back of this page for a complete listing of what is represented in the mural.)\n\nMcLarty's work is in numerous public collections including Buckman School, the Civic Auditorium, Laurelhurst School, Lewis and Clark College, Mt. Hood Community College, the Portland Art Museum, the Seattle Art Museum, the State of Oregon Capitol Collection, the Visual Chronicle of Portland and the newly renovated City Hall.",

        "description": "The idea for this piece had its source in the rough concrete piers and reinforcements that were being excavated from the old waterfront site when I first saw it.  I made a progression using local basalt stone and the existing wrecked concrete.\n    At the top of the berm there is a grouping of sawcut vertical basalt, and some irregular, displaced foundations.  As the basalt pieces progress from berm to river, they tip over, so that the concrete below becomes exposed and the basalt becomes submerged and eventually disappears.\n    At the river path there are various configurations of concrete and stone, including inlays and pieces that can function as seating.  Concrete is cut in various places to expose the river rock aggregate inside as well as the old embedded wood piers, and some heavy steel reinforcement emerges in various plant-like and root-like ways.\n    The work is meant to be a quiet narrative that is derived and retained from the site, rather than a thing that was brought in.",

Sweet Air Bend is composed of four individual 24\" x 26\" panels hung together in a horizontal line.\n\n\"When we slow down, they no longer make sense; their ability to communicate is dependent upon our quick glance.  These collages are all made from cut and reassembled signs.  They seem recognizable at first, yet lose all information upon viewing.  I am interested in the new communication that is formed in their familiar but unreadable symbols. \n\n\"Composition and craftsmanship are two characteristics in artwork that I admire.  I feel that my education, first as a jeweler and later as a fiber artist, not only taught me the respect necessary for this current method of working, but was also instrumental in directing my aesthetic decisions.\"",

        "description": "Headwaters is the moving water at the entry plaza of the Southwest Community Center and it serves as the symbolic headwaters of the park trail system. The water is visually connected to the storm water runoff that is collected and purified in the adjoining bioswale. The natural forms of the river course interlock with the man-made plaza and emphasize the partnership of park and building, a concept reinforced by the location of the watershed education room of the Bureau of Environmental Services.\n\nThe overall project goal was to symbolically connect the community center to its natural setting.   The phrase \"stream of life\" became a metaphor for the flow of human communities past, present, and future in this location that is so intimately linked to a creekside ecosystem. \n\nProject History\nAs a requirement for submitting an architectural proposal for the Community Center, the firm of BOORA Architects had to include an artist on their design team.  Valerie Otani and Nanda D'Agostino were selected by the architects from the Regional Arts & Culture Council's Design Team Roster.  The artists and architects collaborated on the project from the beginning of the design phase. RACC's Public Art Advisory Committee oversaw the artistic portion of the project.",

        "description": "\"Historically, a powerful metaphor for complexity, intricacy, struggle, for seeking and achieving a goal, has been the labyrinth or maze.  Not only can we use it as a metaphor for the planning process, but also as a very real representation of urban street and building elements.\nReferring to the myth of Theseus defeating the minotaur, the crucial golden thread is represented by a winding trail of an inlaid brass strip and text in brass letters.  The text is a list of Portland neighborhood associations which proceeds through the halls and corridors of the first floor before entering the maze and finding its way to the center.  At the center, lies a single, white rose outlined in brass.  As a reward for persistence, it represents our goal of a livable city.\n     Not only is there an obvious connection between mazes and the network of city planning, but there is also a natural human fascination with the intricate and the complex and the desire to strive for and reach a goal.  This artwork functions both in the abstract and the specific in its attempt to symbolize the efforts of the city of Portland to find solutions to quality of life issues.\"",

Twenty-two different languages are represented here in layers of overlapping texts.\n\nThe multi-lingual texts deal with public physical space, consciousness of cultural fragments , and the experience of the different individuals who walk through public spaces.  Paralleling the original formats of several different languages with piercing light represents the contemporary displacement of cultural syntax.\n\nThe layout has relevance to three hexagrams of the Yi-Jing, a Chinese ancient script based on yin and yang.  The hexagrams were chosen for their relationship to the functions of the 1900 Building.  \n\nThe artwork represents the process of beginning, struggling and finding fulfillment.",

At one point in the tale, Alice finally encounters the white rabbit that is late for a party given by the duchess.  However, the rabbit has misplaced its gloves and fan and sends Alice to retrieve them.  As an adult, I still delight in the playfulness of this story and see it as a metaphor for pursuing one's dreams - even when the dream seems beyond one's reach.

        "description": "The idea for Portlandia, a classical allegorical figure representing the spirit of Portland, came from the official Portland City Seal.  The seal depicts a wilderness scene including mountains, forest and the sea.  In the foreground, Lady Commerce, stands on the shore with a trident in her right hand as a ship enters the port behind her.  A sheaf of grain, a cogwheel and a sledgehammer lie to her left in the foreground.  Together, these figures symbolize the origins of the city, its culture, agrarian base, and industry.  \n\nMichael Graves suggested a statue of her as part of his design for the Portland Building.  Raymond J. Kaskey, a Washington, D.C. sculptor, won the commission through the City's Percent for Art program.  The sculpture is made of hammered copper sheeting about the thickness of a dime formed around a steel armature, and the artist spent three years creating this massive work.   She is 1/3 the size of the Statue of Liberty, the only larger statue of this kind in the nation. \n \nPortlandia was shipped across country by rail in eight pieces.  After being assembled in a local shipyard, she rode by river barge and truck to her final destination, welcomed by thousands of Portland residents along the riverbank, streets and bridges.  Her dedication to the citizens of Portland on October 8, 1985, confirmed her acceptance as a new symbol of the city.\n\n\u00a9 Raymond Kaskey. Questions concerning the use of the Portlandia image should be directed to the Regional Arts & Culture Council at 503.823.5111.",

        "description": "Artist's Statement:  \nAs a kid I would go for walks with my father and he would point things out to me. He seemed interested in everything?\"an architectural detail, an old tree, a geological formation, a historical monument, an unusual shop or restaurant. Features otherwise hidden to me would be revealed and made significant while spending time with him.\n\nOver the past eight years I have worked on projects exploring the dynamics of social spaces, communities, and environments. These projects have taken the form of installations, publications, educational activities, and public art pieces and have involved a variety of populations: middle school students in Oakland, office workers from the City of Richmond, local residents from the Sunset District in San Francisco, students living in dorms at the University of Washington, shoppers at a mall in Pleasanton, urban gardeners in the Mission District of San Francisco, among others.\n\nMy project for the Streetcar Alignment brings together my early memories of walks with my father, photography, and my involvement with community based art projects. To do this I will install a series of solar powered lights on motion sensors to literally highlight aspects of the neighborhoods that the streetcar will be running through. The units would be attached to pre-existing street car poles and operate from dusk to late evening. It's evident that these neighborhoods already have cultural and aesthetic qualities that define them.  \n\nThe idea draws strictly on what the various neighborhoods along the alignment already have?\"unusual architecture, old signs, specific trees, old fire hydrants and infrastructure, etc. I will choose several locations to just light a circular spot on the sidewalk that a person could walk into and for a moment stand out for their own visual or gestural significance. In a way, the lights would act as real time photographs of interesting aspects in Portland's nighttime urban environment.",

        "description": "The entire peninsula which sticks into the Smith & Bybee wetlands was created by fill pumping from the bottom of the Columbia River in order to deepen the port facilities for larger freight vessels.  Within clear view of the sculpture site are the port facilities which exist both along the banks of both the Willamette and Columbia Rivers.  Still existing today are many artifacts of marine architecture both old and new, most of which are made from large diameter logs driven into the river bottom and sometimes lashed together with cables.  Cast in rammed earth molds, the Wapato sculpture makes a somewhat ironic connection between the indigenous marine structures held up by the river bottom and the Wapato site which is made out of river bottom.  Specifically, the Wapato sculpture refers to \"dolphins\" used to mark obstructions and provide mooring facilities for boats, and form of  a boat \"in ruin\" which creates a kind of enclosure surrounded by the orchard trees.  The orchard has obvious references to a significant industry in the State of Oregon; but also provides the further conceptual twist of having real trees intertwining themselves with the concrete trees.",

The projection is an inverted image of what exists outside of the window. \n\n\"This artwork is meant to bring everyday changes to our attention.

        "description": "The seven \"Habitat Trees\" at Smith and Bybee Lakes provide nest sites and perches to Tree Swallows, Purple Martins, Warblers, Kestrals, Screech Owls and Bats. The nest sites were developed in collaboration with Metro Naturalists and Audubon Society staff. Our intention is that the \"Habitat Trees\" articulate in dramatic and eye catching ways the peculiar nesting habitats of some of the birds and mammals of the lakes. They also stand as sentinals at three of the critical crossroads of the park's road and trail system. Finally, although the designs are unique and original, the materials and methods of carving recall local traditions. We hope their drama and quirky character will provoke park visitors to take a closer look at the birds and animals around them.",

On the urban panel, bridges are a central design element and refer to how the County \"bridges\" diverse communities, fostering cooperative action and successful societal functioning. The water element refers to the flow of commerce and arts in the community.  \n\nIn the rural panel, the arterial  roads are like capillaries in the circulatory system that supports urban life through agriculture that weave through the Columbia Gorge scenic preserve. Salmon are represented as the best known wild species in the network of environmental stewardship in which the County plays an important ongoing role. These panels also suggest Portland's connection to the Pacific Rim through an oblique reference to the Asian scroll, highlighted especially in the rural composition, with its mountain, falls and Vista House at Crown Point.\n\nI hope this artwork makes people smile as they enter the building to conduct business with the county.",

        "description": "This installation is made up of glass and mica pieces, oil drawings and sculpted wire forms that are covered in more than a million glass beads.  Viewers can rest on the plush velvet cushion to pause and marvel at the ever-changing world of which they are a part.  On a more lyrical note, one can interpret the installation as a chorus of visual poems that allude to the interweaving notions of transformation, life, birth and beauty. \n\nSuspended Migration was commissioned in 2004 by friends and staff as a farewell gift to Mayor Vera Katz who was leaving office at the end of a twelve year tenure. The year before, Mayor Katz had traveled to Bologna, Italy to formalize Portland's Sister City relationship. Suspended Migration is inspired by an art installation Mayor Katz saw during a visit to the 2003 Venice Biennale on that same trip. The installation was meant to be temporary, but was so popular with incoming Mayor Tom Potter, the City Commissioners and City staff, that it became part of City Hall's permanent public art collection.",

        "description": "I began this project with a desire to study a group of people who live in a constant state of readiness and observe how that affects them and their environment.  Even in the face of random emergencies, the firefighters exude a cool steadiness, and each knows exactly what to do without hesitation.  I know this must come through years of training and experience,  but to an outsider, it's a marvel how well they work together.  Teamwork, both inside and outside the station, became a prominent theme within many of the paintings.  \n\nOverall, my experience during this residency has been an extremely humbling one.  To witness someone dying can be very humbling, and to see this group save a person's life is even more humbling.  To meet the individuals who are always willing to fight fires and to see them standing on a smoking roof using a chainsaw, causes me to re-evaluate what it means to serve your community.  I was honored to simply sit at their dinner table and hear their stories.  I hope that the artwork will help document, commemorate, and attest to some of the outstanding service of the Portland Firefighters.",

        "description": "The diversity of the community served by the East Portland fire stations truly amazed me.  From the multitude of elder care facilities to the diverse ethnicity of clients, the 9-1-1 calls serve as windows into the rich culture of our city.  Each time the firefighters go on an emergency call, they treat the clients with respect and compassion.  An important support system for this station are the neighborhood associations that it serves.  They rallied fiercely to keep this station open when it was threatened with closure, and a sign honoring that support  is located in front of the station.\n\nIn 2004, four Portland artists were selected for assignments at five to six fire stations  where they spent time with the crews and went on ride alongs to fire and other emergency calls over the course of one year.

        "description": "Mayor Katz has been a life-long lover of the arts and was very supportive of arts and culture during her years as Mayor.  She was instrumental in establishing the State of Oregon's Percent for Art Program many years ago when she was in the legislature.  That proved a valuable step in the process the City of Portland and Multnomah County followed in adopting their own Percent for Art programs in 1980.  Mayor Katz was pivotal in the development of the Eastbank Esplanade and it seems fitting that her political leadership and love for the arts should come together in a public tribute to her.",

The paintings are more feelings and emotions and ideas about how the world works than anything else.\nThe images are often of women but lately because of my public work boys and men have been central components so my work really is more about humanity.",

        "description": "Just as the history of this neighborhood has been diverse, so the conceptual basis for this project is varied and multiple-layered. Independent of the detail carving that appears in its interior base blocks, each sculpture is identical in form and placement, in response to the festival streets' formal layouts. The structures can also be thought of as symbolic shelters housing their respective detail carvings.\n\nSome of the individual details are carved to suggest that artifacts are embedded within the granite base blocks and plinths. Drawn from extensive research, the content of the detail carvings symbolize one or more of the following subjects: a people of common cultural identity, a place in time, historic uses of nearby structures. For example, the southern sculpture on the 3rd and Davis plinth recalls artifacts from Japantown which stood on that location until the \"relocation\" of Japanese-Americans in 1942, while the north sculpture on 3rd and Flanders pays homage to the building of Portland's rail systems, historic and contemporary. Placed within the context of the \"lantern,\" each of these artifact carvings can be seen conceptually as a source of \"light\" which radiates energy into the community.",

The artist posed questions to the girls of how she could create art that was hopeful yet honest in regards to their present situation of being incarcerated.  The imagery for these paintings evolved out of those conversations.  The  budding white rose is the central focus of the painting, to be viewed as both an object of radiant beauty and a symbol of potential growth. The hands are reaching through the chain link fence, referring to both the physical and emotional barriers that keep us, as humans, confined in prisons of our own making.",

The mural's intention was to reach out to elementary school girls in the St. Johns community, using art and empowerment to critically analyze media messages that influence how girls feel about themselves, and how they treat each other.  The mural represents friendship, growth, community, activity, and empowerment.",

        "description": "Created by internationally renowned artist Kenny Scharf, the Tikitotemoniki Totems, also known as \"Tiki Totems\", are four 30 foot tall sculptures covering streetcar catenary poles near Jamison Square. Scharf is best known for his adaptation of cartoon images for the realm of fine art and the faces depicted in the totems either delight or unnerve passersby, depending on individual point of view. Scharf remarks, \"These four Tiki Totem monikers are a fantasy come true. To realize something of this magnitude is beyond my wildest dreams. I love the way they relate to the Pacific Northwest culture as well as the universal Tiki culture, which extends from the South Pacific through the Northwest and up to Alaska. As I've said before, art should, above all, be fun, and these huge 3D forms translate that perfectly.\"",

Like the Saint Johns bridge above, it is a suspension structure anchored at each end.  The hull-like end pieces allude to the shipbuilding that went on nearby and were constructed using standard steel shipbuilding techniques by Peninsula Iron Works, a third generation firm adjacent to the park.   \"Drawing on the River\" reflects back on a century of industry in St. Johns and is an homage to the both the mills and the workers who ran them.  The piece also invokes the river itself, which powered the mills and is the reason the workers settled here.",

Located on Swan Island, a man-made home to heavy industry, the sculpture echoes an ecological approach to the built environment wherein manufacturing is interwoven with our shared natural resources.\n\nAlthough the Big Pipe Project is the largest infrastructure project in Portland history, it is largely invisible.  Working closely with the Bureau of Environmental Services, the sculpture celebrates this hidden work by revealing and readapting massive precast concrete segments of the Big Pipe.  These pieces of infrastructure are now put to work in support of art and narrative.  Partially buried in the alluvial bank, the sculpture traces out the circumference of the hidden pipe and transforms it from an industrial artifact into a woven arch of currents and eddies.",

        "description": "A progression of increments, marking departure and arrival, marking a path; these basic aspects of time and travel have governed my approach to the three Union Station sites. As I considered ways in which humans mark pathways, I thought of cairns, those man-made stacks of stones that mark hiking trails and which historically have served as landmarks for land and sea navigation, memorials, and commemorative markers. Travelers on cross-country trails traditionally add stones to cairns as they pass, resulting in animated and precarious stacks of rocks and pebbles. This evidence of human comings and goings, these reminders that others have followed the same path signify safety and reassurance out in the wilderness. In the urban wilderness, finding one's way through the various stages of hurry-up-and-wait are just as significant. These stand-alone works speak to the step-by-step marking of time, and incorporate varying degrees of elegance and playfulness. They are related to each other through this thematic underpinning and through the use of stone, but each responds to its site in its own way.\n\n(For more information visit: http://trimet.org/publicart/greenline/index.htm)",

        "description": "With The Green Man of Portland, I have created a fake legend. It goes like this: ever since Portland's founding there have been sightings of small green archers. Whenever the archer hits someone with an arrow, her vision changes. Flowers grow from the heads of passersby, a building called The Greenwood appears, and a giant tree towers over the city. On certain nights, a great white celestial stag is spied in the skies over Portland.\n\nThe piece consists of two sculptures and eight \"story markers,\" told as a poem over ten blocks of Old Town and Chinatown. The images in the panels combine the visual language of seventies horror comics and WPA posters. Pedestrians and riders come upon the story in fragments, depending on their routes through the neighborhood.\n\nThe legend encompasses all the varied, transitory communities that call Old Town and Chinatown home. My great hope for this piece is that The Green Man of Portland will quietly twine itself into the fabric and many-layered history of the community. \n\n(Courtesy of TriMet.

The artist's father was a tailor, and growing up he was influenced by watching him work with templates to cut pattern pieces.\n\nThis free-standing aluminum sculpture maintains a flat surface but the painted interior shapes that overlap and interlock give the illusion of dimension. To Katz, this is a painting issue. The lower half of the sculpture, with its elongated black shapes and welded base plates, suggest pant legs. This became his reason for naming it Daddy Long Legs.\n\n(Courtesy of TriMet. For more information visit: http://trimet.org/publicart/greenline/index.htm)",

Lodge grass is also the name for a range of plants used by indigenous peoples to make shelters. As the environment has evolved and useful plants such as lodge grass have disappeared, the thistle and other noxious weeds have replaced them, in the same way that wilderness areas have been replaced by suburban developments.\n\nIn this sculpture the artist has substituted symbols and imagery for the figure's head and shoulders. One form is an abstract shape suggesting a teepee reflected in water. The other more dominant form is that of a thistle, the first plant to pop back up after you've cleared the land.\n\n(Courtesy of TriMet.

He always found these hand-built instruments to be remarkable and fascinating, especially the mechanical action organs. While most people appreciate the sound of the instrument and the casework, he is drawn to the processes that go into the construction of the organ.\n\n(Courtesy of TriMet.

At the center of the sculpture is the Native American trickster?\"coyote?\"representing life that is out of balance. On the back of the coyote is the Grandmother's mask. In many tribal communities, the matriarchs are the doctors who put lives back in balance.\n\nAbove the Grandmother's mask sits a coastal bird, the Killdeer. This legendary mothering bird distracts predators approaching the nest by acting wounded and hobbling away.\n\nRepresenting the struggles of parenthood, a pair of salmon circle a burden basket. Salmon endure great hardships and eventually give up their own lives to have children. A lamprey eel feeds on the male salmon, showing us the naturally occurring interdependence of species.\n\nPeering out of the burden basket is a smiling infant modeled after the artist's daughter, Lily. The sculpture started out expressing the difficult circumstances and troubled life of single parents, often grandparents stepping in to raise a child. But when Bartow placed Lily in the basket it became a hopeful, encouraging and optimistic work\n\n(Courtesy of TriMet. For more information visit: http://trimet.org/publicart/greenline/index.htm)",

        "description": "In conceiving City Reflections, Patti Warashina thought about life on an urban public walkway. The transit mall between Salmon and Main, where her two bronze sculptures are located, is in the heart of Portland where business, civics and culture all come together.\n\nThe standing figure is a stylized version of a strong female in both a classical and minimal form. The watching dog acts as a counterbalance to the female figure and is the friendly canine companion that is so much a part of our popular culture.\n\nBlack geometric shapes on the bronze sculptures reference elements of the human body and reflect the shapes and shadows of the surrounding buildings. The black shadows on the sidewalk serve as a natural transition to the pedestrians on the street, as well as indicating the time of day.\n\nThe smaller copper shapes scattered on the surface of the figures represent computer-generated forms, which speak to the times we live in. \n\n(Courtesy of TriMet.

        "description": "Puzzle Tower, by Chris Gander, consists of five basic geometric forms designed as an exploration of symmetry, visual balance and the creation of something familiar out of something unknown or new. The artist intentionally kept these forms basic and slightly vague in origin; they can be thought of as structural or architectural.\n\nThe act of combining these forms in new, perhaps unexpected, ways presented interesting problems to Gander as an object maker. He equates the act of solving these problems to basic human tendencies: searching for meaning, significance and understanding.\n\nJust as puzzles rely on clues and speculations for their resolutions, Puzzle Tower invites viewers to make connections?\"to speculate and find meaningful personal references from something unknown or unfamiliar. It's the artist's hope they will equate this experience to the act of thinking and resolving.\n\n(Courtesy of TriMet. For more information visit: http://trimet.org/publicart/greenline/index.htm)",

        "description": "With the five sculptures that make up Continuation, Michihiro Kosuge re-used red granite from an earlier sculpture and fountain installation on the bus mall. The designated location for the work was unusual in that it encompassed the outdoor spaces of the Hotel Modera as well as the adjoining sidewalk. For the artist, the material and the site presented both opportunities and challenges. In particular, he wanted to create relationships between the multiple pieces while allowing each piece to stand on its own.\n\nFor the concept, Kosuge began by studying the stones, which were relatively small and with curved edges. Their size and shape were central in determining what the final work would look like.\n\nThe resulting five sculptures involve interconnecting visual elements that include repetition, tension and stability. Hopefully, each viewer will have a unique opportunity to enjoy the pieces from different perspectives and to understand the relationship of the sculptural shapes to one another.  \n\n(Courtesy of TriMet.

        "description": "My concept for Urban Hydrology was to create a visually compelling urban journey that reveals some of the investigations in environmental science taking place at nearby Portland State University. A professor there told me that one problem humans have in addressing environmental problems is our limited ability to perceive at different scales. Many important things are simply too small or too large for us to comprehend. This made me think it would be valuable to reveal some hidden phenomenon, in particular the beautiful single-celled organisms used to evaluate water quality in urban streams.\n\nTwelve oversized diatoms carved in granite are sited in the biofiltration strips unique to the the southern portion of the transit mall. Placing them in the water filtration strips adds a supporting layer of content to the landscape.Unbeknownst to me, the project was recently shown as part of a presentation at the North American Diatom Symposium, delighting the audience of scientists.\n\nWith Urban Hydrology, I tried to thread the needle between beauty, abstraction and content to appeal to both academic and casual viewers.\n\n(Courtesy of TriMet.

        "description": "Tread Lightly is a multifaceted installation integrated into the Ed Benedict Skate Plaza which provokes thought regarding the intersection of the existing environment and the human made and points towards a search for balance. It is intended to kick start a personal journey with some of the concepts and ideas of sustainability. It also aims to create a greater sense of home and form more of a personal connection with the skaters who spend time in the plaza.\n\nTread Lightly consists of four elements. The first two, landMARK1 and landMARK2, give the appearance of being cut out of the concrete slab, lifted up and rotated aside. The iconic nature of the forms makes an instant and memorable mark in the viewer's mind but also begs the question, what do they stand for? The short answer is emblazoned throughout the plaza with the third element, Opposites, a series of contrasting words stamped throughout the skatepark's concrete. The last element, called upRISING, continues the idea of balance by creating a feeling of the earth pushing a rectangular concrete slab up and off of it's back.",

It is purposely abstract in order to be more open ended and create energy for the viewer to step into the mural. It provides multiple vantage points from which to view nature, elements of human intervention, and their place in nature. All greens used in the mural match the neighborhood region and are considered by the artists to be planetary and universal as they are brought into the neighborhood through the mural.",

The mural is designed to reflect the student's diversity, to highlight the theme of unity, and to foster a sense of community in the neighborhood. The mural is divided into three sections by bands of Aztec symbols. The center features mother earth in the form of Turtle Island, and within it are the colors of the Medicine Wheel, which symbolize our relationship with one another. Each quadrant of the turtle shell features a different mythological and powerful woman. The turtle is surrounded by the four elements. The left and right sections of the mural depict a symbolic mirror reflection of the symbiotic relationship between the earth and her occupants. On one side is the hummingbird and the rose and on the other is the Tree of Life and the Sun Dancer.",

It has greatly enhanced my understanding and respect for the men and women of Portland Fire & Rescue. \n \nIn 2004, four Portland artists were selected for assignments at five to six fire stations where they spent time with the crews and went on ride alongs to fire and other emergency calls over the course of one year.  This project was part of intersections, a public art residency program, that explores the convergence of the \"art of work\" and the \"work of art\" by having artists work directly with city or county resources, staff, and clients.",

Argentine filete, an art style native to Buenos Aires, and Argentine tango are culturally inseparable. The idea of this mural is to showcase this connection. Also, as both art forms are descendant from European traditions, and as the Foster-Powell neighborhood becomes more culturally diverse with many European immigrants, it seeks to embody the essence of the community. The mural with tango dancers' feet on the dance floor and a bandone\u00f3n--an accordion-like instrument--playing tango shows what is happening inside the building. The colors and faux Buenos Aires look will create an enjoyable cultural exchange within the neighborhood by putting the vision out for all to see.",

        "description": "The detention ponds located near Smith Lake allow for a teaching moment along the trail. Rich with plants such as wapato, camas, and nettles, it shows a landscape that Native Americans depended on. Inspired by the forms of Chinook canoes, the sculptural elements carved from columnar basalt evoke the use of the lake as a seasonal encampment for fishing and harvesting. The Chinook were famous for their dugout canoes that allowed them to establish an extensive trading network throughout the Columbia River basin. The casual grouping of the canoe forms evokes an interrupted moment in daily life, and creates an emotional connection between past and present.",

Birdhouses provide bird habitat and the perches reference bird feathers, beaks and some of the tools used in the sewer treatment plant.  Looking through the three holes in the \"Periscope Stone\" you'll see the favorite perch for Bald Eagles that frequent the park in early spring, the composter at the treatment plant, and the biggest snag (favorite all round habitat) on the site.",

        "description": "Mercurial Sky is an ever-changing array of light played on LED tubes integrated into the Director Park Canopy.  The digital video only emits from the lighted bars, and provides a sense of movement through an abstract tapestry of light and color.  If you stand farther away, or look in nearby reflections, the images are compressed and give a clearer view of the video. \n\n\"I filmed images and patterns of natural phenomena like waves, clouds, fire, earthworms, and jellyfish to bring the movement and randomness of nature into this mostly hardscaped park.\"",
