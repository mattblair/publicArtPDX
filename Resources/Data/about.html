<h2>About the PublicArtPDX app</h2>

<p>On my first visit to Portland in 1999, I spent an afternoon hopping on and off the MAX Blue Line, brochure in hand, exploring the art that adorns each light-rail station between downtown Portland and the western suburbs.</p>
<p>Twelve years later, I&#8217;m thrilled to present Portland's Public Art to a broader audience, in a new format. I hope this app is a tool for learning, discovery, and inspiration &ndash; and I hope it builds new connections between citizens, visitors, artists and ideas. <em>&mdash; Matt Blair</em></p>

<h2>About RACC</h2>
<p>Over the course of 30 years, the City of Portland and Multnomah County have built a nationally renowned public art collection that infuses our government buildings, parks, community centers, libraries, streetscapes and fire stations with art. The Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council is the steward of this collection, with over 400 permanently-sited works included in this app.  There are more than 1800 artworks overall, funded by percent-for-art ordinances, private developers, donations and special project funds. Browse the entire collection online at <a href="http://www.racc.org/publicart">http://www.racc.org/publicart</a>.</p>

<h2>Support the Creative Advocacy Network</h2>
 
<p>The Creative Advocacy Network has launched a movement to increase public funding for the arts in our region. Why? Because we know that the arts can inspire kids and keep them in school, revive neighborhoods and enrich communities and create jobs and fuel the economy. It is time to make sure that every child and every community enjoys access to the arts. Join the movement.</p>
